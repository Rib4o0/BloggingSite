People were living on autopilot for so long, adhering to standards imposed by society, doing what needed to be done, without keeping track on how they spend their time."},{"text":"As mental health became something people took seriously, it was inevitable that we would go to the cause of these issues and analyze what we do with our lives, and that is tracking habits."}]},{"title":"The unrealistic habits movement","content":[{"text":"The huge talk about habits and attention spent on it, sparked a lot of analysis into high performers, celebrities, CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors and any personality that is even remotely famous or has a following."},{"text":"Out of these podcasts, books and YouTube videos, there appeared a multitude of habits and routines that are not only unsustainable and unrealistic, but they might cause anxiety and strain on the body, which defies the purpose of having them in the first place."},{"text":"So let me tell you something once and for all:"},{"quote":"You don’t have to wake up at 5am, if that doesn’t work for you"},{"text":"You don’t have to do anything.

As some of you might know, dogs go to sleep pretty early and don’t tend to sleep in. This forced me to leave parties earlier, prioritize sleep and go to bed earlier because I was woken up pretty early in the morning."},{"text":"They key takeaways here are:","style":"bold"},{"list":[{"text":"Go to bed relatively earlier and wake up earlier (follow the natural circadian rhythm of your body)"},{"text":"Sleep for 8 hours (at least 7, at most 9)"},{"text":"Wake up at the end of a sleep cycle.

To avoid needing another coffee at lunchtime or in the afternoon, drink your first one 1–2 hours after you wake up."},{"text":"As Atomic Habits describes amazingly, each habit has a cue. Usually, waking up is our signal to go get coffee. To add or remove habits, you need to play around with the cues."},{"text":"For example, I am using the waking up cue, to get dressed and go to the gym. After that, I come home and get ready for work. At 9:00 when I turn on my laptop, that’s my cue to drink my coffee.
